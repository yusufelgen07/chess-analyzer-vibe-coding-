## 🐞 Known Issues

|  #  | Issue                     | Description                                                          |
| :-: | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1  | Repeated motifs           | Same tactical idea appears across multiple moves.                    |
|  2  | Pin detection (self)      | Potential pins by the player sometimes not detected.                 |
|  3  | Missing break logic       | No logic for identifying when motifs (like skewers/pins) are broken. |
|  4  | Redundant motifs          | Same pin suggested multiple times by different pieces.               |
|  5  | “Removal of Guard (Self)” | Needs logical correction.                                            |
|  6  | Potential fork flaws      | Doesn’t consider opponent’s immediate response.                      |
